# Design Goals
- Simple
- Flexible (quick blog, vs large complex wiki vs corporate use)
- ReadOnly from first principals (allows safe caching)
- Bind to DB or file-system
- Stream-aware (safe for large files)
- Implemented MarkDown (or similar)
- Highly extensible for in-line rendering

## DAL
- JSON
- File-System (or DB)
- REST-like (web service)

## Higher-Order concerns
- Security
- Version Control
- Publishing
- Searching
- Rendering & Rendering Plug-ins

## Nice To Haves
- Inline edit
- Drag/Drop, paste images
